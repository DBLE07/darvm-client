# darvm

a set of clients and servers for accessing your gaming rigs through school computers ;>

the name is because each gamer has their own virtual machine on the host server (running headless debian) and the one who gave me the idea is named darvy and he's like a meme at school so I named it after him.

Keep in mind darvm is designed not to be port forwarded (to save the time SSL takes to implement). It was designed to be accessed through a VPN I already had set up beforehand and I think it works great the way it is right now so I don't want to tear the entire thing apart just so I can add some encryption I'll never even use.
